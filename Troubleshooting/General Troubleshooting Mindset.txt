General Troubleshooting Mindset


1. Stay Calm and Logical

	Donâ€™t assume. Observe.

	Replicate the issue if possible.


2. Start Simple

	Is it plugged in?

	Is the system powered on?

	Is the user input correct?


3. Document Everything

	Record errors, steps, and changes made.


4. Use the Elimination Method

	Rule out possible causes one by one.

5. Ask Questions

	What changed recently?

	When did the issue start?
